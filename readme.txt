hi everyone!

PROBLEM:

This is an attempt to make education and knowledge free for all. Edtech companies today, play on poor parents' insecurity about their children's future, that gets them to buy into expensive gadgets and programs that have little relationship to providing a solid educational foundation for their kids.

I feel these paid courses are unnecessary and predatory in nature, since wonderful study materials are available for free on the internet. But most parents fall into this guilt-trap and end up buying the packages for their kids.

SOLUTION: We create a platform that will act as a dictionary to online study materials that are freely available on the internet.

Kids can choose their class, the subject they want to learn, and the platform will automatically display a list of resources(websites/videos/articles) related to that subject and chapter.

About the project:

I will keep this as an open source project, where everyone contribute with their share of resources. Also I dont intend to take any monetary benefits from this project.

Thank you!
